        Welcome to Peterson's and Sons and Friends Bits & Parts Limited! We are a company that creates both bits and parts for costomers to use. 
        We ensure the quality of all our product and are constantly working to improve. 
        We were founded by Mr. Peterson and his 3 sons and 4 friends in June of 1964 and have been going strong ever since. 
        The goal of this company was to provide quality bits and parts to people in need. Before this company was established, 
        bits and parts were hard to come by and much too expensive. But now, thanks to Mr. Peterson, his 3 sons, and his 4 friends, 
        we can proudly provide bits and parts to everyone and a more accessible price. 
        <br> <br> If you have any questions about any of our bits or parts please send us an email and we will respond as quickly as possible!
